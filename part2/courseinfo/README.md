# FS Open 2022 - Part 2 | Course Info

## Exercise 2.1

The content of the `App` component changes.

- [x] Define a component responsible for formatting a _single_ course called `Course`.

The component structure can be something like this:

```
App
  Course
    Header
    Content
      Part
      Part
      ...
```

This application must work regardless of the number of **parts** a course has. Make sure the console doesn't show any errors.

## Exercise 2.2

- [x] Show the sum of all the exercises in the course

## Exercise 2.3

- [x] If you haven't done it yet, do Ex 2.2, but this time, with the `reduce` method.

## Exercise 2.4

- [x] Extend the app so it can take in an arbitrary number of **courses**

## Exercise 2.5

- [x] Declare the `Course` component as a separate module which you'll import into the `App` component. All subcomponents of `Course` can be included in the same module.
