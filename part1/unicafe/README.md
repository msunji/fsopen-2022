## Exercise 1.6

-[x] Implement an app that collects customer feedback - good, neutral, bad. No need to save to localStorage or anything at this point. You'll need to display the total number of feedback collected for each category.

## Exercise 1.7

-[ ] Add more statistics: total number of collected feedback, average score, percentage of positive feedback

## Exercise 1.8

-[ ] Refactor the application so that statistics are extracted into another component.

## Exercise 1.9

-[ ] Make it so that the app ONLY shows feedback once it's been gathered.

## Exercise 1.10

-[ ] We continue refactoring the app by extracting the following two components: `Button` for defining the feedback buttons and `StatisticLine` for displaying a _single_ statistic

## Exercise 1.11

-[ ] Display statistics in an HTML table
