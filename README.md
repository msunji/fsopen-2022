# Full Stack Open 2022

This course is an intro to modern web app development with JS. It covers a number of different topics, ranging from React, Redux, Node.js, to MongoDB, GraphQL and testing. You read more about this course [here](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about).

I try my best to get all the exercises done, and then write short explanations for each exercise I've completed. The course is pretty extensive and is 13 parts long. Here's a record of what I've been doing so far:
